# Purpose
This is a scaffolding-project to get some three-js tests off the ground quickly. It originated from a couple of other attempts and clones of similar projects that used some older versions, like [brandflugan's repo](https://github.com/brandflugan/three-js-webpack-boilerplate).  

Most of the dependencies are the same, albeit a newer version (for now at least). The project that is included is the default spinning cube, since I didn't actually go any further yet. 

# How to start
```npm start```
